# Compiling NWChem from source


On this page, a step-by-step description of the build process and
necessary and optional environment variables is outlined. In addition,
based on the experiences of developers and users how-to's for various
platforms have been created. These how-to's will be updated with
additional platforms and better environment variables over time.  

Download of the NWChem source is a step needed before compilation. Details for downloading
as well as instructions for installing pre-compiled version of NWChem are available at the
[Download page](Download).

## Setting up the proper environment variables

  - `$NWCHEM_TOP` defines the top directory of the NWChem source tree,
    e.g.

When dealing with source from a ***NWChem release*** (6.8 in this example)
```
export NWCHEM_TOP=<your path>/nwchem-6.8
```
  - `$NWCHEM_TARGET` defines your target platform, e.g.
```
export NWCHEM_TARGET=LINUX64
```
The following platforms are available:

| NWCHEM_TARGET | Platform | OS         | Compilers |
|---------------|:---------|------------|-----------|
| LINUX         | x86      | Linux      | GNU, Intel, PGI|
|               | ppc      | Linux      | GNU, IBM  |
|               | arm      | Linux      | GNU, flang |
| LINUX64       | x86_64   | Linux      | GNU, Intel, PGI, Flang|
|               | ppc64le  | Linux      | GNU, IBM |
|               | aarch64  | Linux      | GNU, flang |
| MACX          | x86      | Darwin     | GNU, Intel |
| MACX64 	| x86_64   | Darwin     | GNU, Intel |
| BGL           |Blue Gene/L|           | IBM |
| BGP           |Blue Gene/P|           | IBM |
| BGQ           |Blue Gene/Q|           | IBM |
  
<br>
  
  - `$ARMCI_NETWORK` must be defined in order to achieve best
    performance on high performance networks, e.g.
```
export ARMCI_NETWORK=MPI-PR
```
For a single processor system, this environment variable does not have
to be defined.
Supported combination of ARMCI_NETWORK and NWCHEM_TARGET variables:  


| ARMCI_NETWORK | NWCHEM_TARGET | Network               | Protocol  |
| --------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| OPENIB 	| LINUX, LINUX64|Mellanox InfiniBand    | Verbs     |
| MPI-PR 	| LINUX64 	|Any network 	        |   MPI     |
| MPI-MT<br />MPI-SPAWN| LINUX64|MPI supporting<br />multi-threading multiple| 	MPI-2|
| MPI-TS<br /> MPI-PT|any 	        |any network with MPI 	|   MPI     |
| BGMLMPI 	| BGL   	| IBM Blue Gene/L 	| BGLMPI    |
| DC		MFMPI 	| BGP   	| IBM Blue Gene/P 	| DCMF,MPI  |
  
<br>

Please see [Choosing the ARMCI Library](ARMCI) for
additional information on choosing the right network
options. Using MPI-PR is strongly suggested.

### MPI variables

| Variable     | Description |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_MPI`    | Set to "y" to indicate that NWChem should be compiled with MPI                   |
| `USE_MPIF`   | Set to "y" for the NWPW module to use fortran-bindings of MPI. <br /> (Generally set when USE_MPI is set)                               |
| `USE_MPIF4`  | Set to "y" for the NWPW module to use Integer\*4 fortran-bindings of MPI. <br /> (Generally set when USE_MPI is set on most platforms) |
| `LIBMPI` (deprecated)    | Name of the MPI library that should be linked with -l               |
| `MPI_LIB` (deprecated)   | Directory where the MPI library resides                                          |
| `MPI_INCLUDE` (deprecated)| Directory where the MPI include files reside                                     |  
  
<br>  
  
#### <span style="color:red;">Automatic detection of MPI variables with mpif90</span>

**_New in NWChem 6.6_**: If the
location of the `mpif90` command is part of your `PATH` env. variable,
NWChem will figure out the values of `LIBMPI`, `MPI_LIB` and `MPI_INCLUDE`
(if they are not set). Therefore, we do **NOT** recommend to set `LIBMPI`,
`MPI_LIB` and `MPI_INCLUDE` and add the location of `mpif90` to the `PATH`
variable, instead. Therefore, the next section can be considered obsolete.

#### OBSOLETE: How to set the MPI variables
The information of this section should not be used because of the automatic detection of MPI variables described in the previous 
[section](#automatic-detection-of-mpi-variables-with-mpif90).  

~~The output of the command~~

<pre><code><del>mpif90 -show</del></code></pre>


~~can be used to extract the values of LIBMPI, MPI\_LIB and MPI\_INCLUDE~~

~~E.g. for MPICH2, this might look like:~~
<pre><code><del>
$ mpif90 -show
f95 -I/usr/local/mpich2.141p1/include -I/usr/local/mpich2.141p1/include -L/usr/local/mpich2.141p1/lib \
-lmpichf90 -lmpichf90 -lmpich -lopa -lmpl -lrt -lpthread
</del></code></pre>
~~The corresponding environment variables are~~
<pre><code><del>
  % export USE_MPI=y
  % export LIBMPI="-lmpich -lopa -lmpl -lpthread -lmpichf90 -lfmpich -lmpich"
  % export MPI_LIB=/usr/local/mpich2.141p1/lib 
  % export MPI_INCLUDE='/usr/local/mpich2.141p1/include
</del></code></pre>

#### How to start NWChem

When MPI is used, the appropriate MPI run command should be used to
start an NWChem calculation, e.g.
```
  % mpirun -np 8 $NWCHEM_TOP/bin/$NWCHEM_TARGET/nwchem h2o.nw
```

### NWCHEM_MODULES

  - `$NWCHEM_MODULES` defines the modules to be compiled, e.g.
```
export NWCHEM_MODULES="all python"
```
The following modules are available:

| Module     | Description                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| all        | Everything useful             |
| all python | Everything useful plus python |
| qm         | All quantum mechanics modules |
| md         | MD only build                 |
  
<br>
Note that additional environment variables need to be defined to specify
the location of the Python libraries, when the python module is
compiled. See the optional environmental variables section for
specifics.

## Adding optional environmental variables

**USE_NOFSCHECK** can be set to avoid NWChem creating files for each
process when testing the size of the scratch directory (a.k.a. creation
of junk files), e.g.
```
export USE_NOFSCHECK=TRUE
```
**USE_NOIO** can be set to avoid NWChem 6.5 doing I/O for the ddscf,
mp2 and ccsd modules (it automatically sets `USE_NOFSCHECK`, too). It is
strongly recommended on large clusters or supercomputers or any computer
lacking any fast and large local filesystem.
```
export USE_NOIO=TRUE
```
**LIB_DEFINES** can be set to pass additional defines to the C
preprocessor (for both Fortran and C), e.g.
```
export LIB_DEFINES=-DDFLT_TOT_MEM=16777216
```
Note: `-DDFLT_TOT_MEM` sets the default dynamic memory available for
NWChem to run, where the units are in doubles. Instead of manually
defining this environment variable, one can use the [getmem.nwchem](https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem/blob/master/contrib/getmem.nwchem) script in the
`$NWCHEM_TOP/contrib` directory. This script should be run after an
initial build of the binary has been completed. The script will choose the default memory settings based on the available physical memory, recompile the appropriate files and relink. Here is an example of its usage:  
```
cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src
../contrib/getmem.nwchem
```
A test suite failure in the `h2o-b3lyp-disp` test in release 7.2.0 has been reported if `-DDFLT_TOT_MEM` is set manually without using the `getmem.nwchem` script as suggested above.

If non default compiler are used, the `getmem.nwchem` script must be called, using bash shell, by first specifying the compiler environment variable. The example below  uses ifort as Fortran compiler
```
cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src
FC=ifort ../contrib/getmem.nwchem
```
**MRCC_METHODS** can be set to request the multireference coupled
cluster capability to be included in the code, e.g.
```
export MRCC_METHODS=TRUE
```

**CCSDTQ** can be set to request the CCSDTQ method and its derivatives 
to be included in the code, e.g.
```
export CCSDTQ=TRUE
```
### Setting Python environment variables

Python programs may be embedded into the NWChem input and used to
control the execution of NWChem. To build with Python, Python needs to
be available on your machine. The software can be download from
<https://www.python.org> . Follow the Python instructions for
installation and testing. NWChem has been tested with Python versions
up to 3.11

The following environment variables need to be set when compiling with
Python, together with having the location of your installed python binary part of
the `PATH` environment variable:
```
export PYTHONVERSION=3.8
```
Note that the third number in the version should not be kept: 3.8.1
should be set as 3.8

You will also need to set PYTHONPATH to include any modules that you are
using in your input. Examples of Python within NWChem are in the
`$NWCHEM_TOP/QA/tests/pyqa3` and `$NWCHEM_TOP/contrib/python` directories.

### Optimized math libraries

By default NWChem uses its own basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS).
To include faster BLAS routines, the environment variable BLASOPT needs
to be set before building the code. For example, with
OpenBLAS
```
export BLASOPT="-lopenblas"
```
Good choices of optimized BLAS libraries on x86 (e.g. LINUX and LINUX64)
hardware include:  

|             |                                                                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BLIS        | <https://github.com/flame/blis>                                                               |    
| OpenBLAS    | <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS>                                                          |
| GotoBLAS    | <https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-software/gotoblas2>                    |  
| Intel MKL   | <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html>                  |
| Cray LibSci | Available only on Cray hardware, it is automatically linked when compiling on Cray computers. |
| IBM ESSL    | Available only on IBM hardware <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/essl/6.3> |

<br>  
  
_**New since release 7.0.0**_ (after commit [6b0a971](https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem/commit/6b0a971207e776f43dec81974014e86caf8cee61#diff-1750a4dcc9a0a9b1773d275e96c46a1e )):  If `BLASOPT` is defined, the `LAPACK_LIB` environment variable must be set up, too.  `LAPACK_LIB` must provide the location of the library containing the LAPACK routines. For example, OpenBLAS provides the full suite of LAPACK routines, therefore, in this case, `LAPACK_LIB` can be set to the same value as BLASOPT  
```  
export BLASOPT=-lopenblas  
export LAPACK_LIB=-lopenblas  
```   
  
NWChem can also take advantage of the [ScaLAPACK
library](http://netlib.org/scalapack/) if it is installed on your
system. The following environment variables need to be set:
```
export USE_SCALAPACK=y
  
export SCALAPACK="location of Scalapack and BLACS library"
```
### How to deal with integer size of Linear Algebra libraries 
In the case of 64-bit platforms, most vendors optimized BLAS
libraries cannot be used. This is due to the fact that while NWChem uses
64-bit integers (i.e. integer\*8) on 64-bit platforms, most of the
vendors optimized BLAS libraries used 32-bit integers. The same holds
for the ScaLAPACK libraries, which internally use 32-bit integers.  
The BLAS_SIZE environment variable is used at compile time to set the size of integer arguments in BLAS calls.  


| BLAS_SIZE | size of integer arguments in BLAS routines |
|:--:| -- |
| 4 | 32-bit (most common default)  |
| 8 | 64-bit |


A method is available to link against the libraries mentioned above,
using the following procedure:
```
   cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src
   make clean
   make 64_to_32
   make USE_64TO32=y  BLAS_SIZE=4 BLASOPT=" optimized BLAS" SCALAPACK="location of Scalapack and BLACS library"
```
E.g., for IBM64 this looks like

```
  % make USE_64TO32=y BLAS_SIZE=4 BLASOPT="-lessl -lmass"
```

Notes:

  - Starting with release 7.2.0 when building from a release archive the 
    `make 64_to_32` step is not required. Executing  `make 64_to_32`
    will just print the message `make: '64_to_32' is up to date.`
  - GotoBLAS2 (or OpenBLAS) can be installed with 64bit integers. This
    is accomplished by compiling the GotoBLAS2 library after having
    edited the GotoBLAS2 Makefile.rule file and un-commenting the line
    containing the INTERFACE64 definition. In other words, the line
```
          #INTERFACE64 = 1
```
   needs to be changed to
```
          INTERFACE64 = 1
```
  - ACML and MKL can support 64-bit integers if the appropriate library
    is chosen. For MKL, one can choose the ILP64 Version of Intel® MKL
    and the correct recipe can be extracted from the website
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl-link-line-advisor.html>.
    For ACML the int64 libraries should be chosen, e.g. in the case of
    ACML 4.4.0 using a PGI compiler
    /opt/acml/4.4.0/pgi64_int64/lib/libacml.a
  - A runtime fail has been reported in release 7.2.0 for the 32-bit integer version
    if the MKL is statically linked.
    
**_New in NWChem 7.0.2_**:   

1. The environment variable `BUILD_OPENBLAS` can be used to automatically build the OpenBLAS library during a NWChem compilation (either using `BLAS_SIZE=8` or `BLAS_SIZE=4`)  
2. The environment variable `BUILD_SCALAPACK` can be used to automatically build the ScaLapack library during a NWChem compilation (either using `SCALAPACK_SIZE=8` or `SCALAPACK_SIZE=4`)

The following settings are strongly recommended:
```
BUILD_OPENBLAS=1
BUILD_SCALAPACK=1
BLAS_SIZE=8
SCALAPACK_SIZE=8
```

### Linking in NBO

The 5.0 (obsolete) version of NBO provides a utility to generate source
code that can be linked into computational chemistry packages such as
NWChem. To utilize this functionality, follow the instructions in the
NBO 5 package to generate an nwnbo.f file. Linking NBO into NWChem can
be done using the following procedure:
```
  % cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src 
  % cp nwnbo.f $NWCHEM_TOP/src/nbo/.  
  % make nwchem_config NWCHEM_MODULES="all nbo" 
  % make
```
One can now use "task nbo" and incorporate NBO input into the NWChem
input file directly:
```
 nbo  
   $NBO NRT $END  
   ... 
 end  
  
 task nbo
```
## Building the NWChem binary

Once all required and optional environment variables have been set,
NWChem can be compiled:
```
  % cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src  
  
  % make nwchem_config 
  
  % make >& make.log
```
The make above will use the standard compilers available on your system.
To use compilers different from the default one can either set
environment variables:
```
  % export FC=<fortran compiler>  
  % export CC=<c compiler>
```
Or one can supply the compiler options to the make command (_recommended_ option), e.g:
```
  % make FC=ifort 
```
For example, on Linux FC could be set either equal to ifort, gfortran or pgf90

**Nota bene:** NWChem does NOT support usage of the full path in FC and
CC variables. Please provide filenames only as in the examples above\!

Note 1: If in a Linux environment, FC is set equal to anything other
than the tested compilers, there is no guarantee of a successful
installation, since the makefile structure has not been tested to
process other settings. In other words, please avoid make FC="ifort -O3 -xhost"
and stick to make FC="ifort", instead

Note 2: It's better to avoid redefining CC, since a) NWChem does not
have C source that is a computational bottleneck and b) we typically
test just the default C compiler. In other words, the recommendation is
to compile with make FC=ifort

Note 3: It's better to avoid modifying the values of the FOPTIMIZE and
COPTIMIZE variables. The reason is that the default values for FOPTIMIZE
and COPTIMIZE have been tested by the NWChem developers (using the
internal QA suites, among others), while any modification might produce
incorrect results.

## How-to: Linux platforms

  - **Common environmental variables for building in serial or in
    parallel with MPI**
```
 % export NWCHEM_TOP=<your path>/nwchem  
 % export NWCHEM_TARGET=LINUX64  
 % export NWCHEM_MODULES =all
```
  - **Common environmental variables for building with MPI**

The following environment variables need to be set when NWChem is
compiled with
MPI:
```
% export USE_MPI=y
% export USE_MPIF=y
% export USE_MPIF4=y

```
**New in NWChem 6.6:** If the location of the mpif90 command is part of
your PATH env. variable, NWChem will figure out the values of LIBMPI,
MPI_LIB and MPI_INCLUDE (if they are not set). Therefore, we recommend
not to set LIBMPI, MPI_LIB and MPI_INCLUDE and add the location of
mpif90 to the PATH variable, instead.

  - **Compiling the code once all variables are set**
```
% cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src
% make nwchem_config
% make FC=gfortran >& make.log
```

#### Method \#2: using gfortran and openmpi from brew

  - Download and unpack latest NWChem tarball to the directory of your
    choosing, say /Users/johndoe/nwchem
  - Install Homebrew as described at <http://brew.sh> (more details at
    <https://docs.brew.sh/Installation.html>)

<!-- end list -->

``` 
 /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" 
```

  - Use Homebrew to install open-mpi
```
brew install open-mpi
```
  - As usual, set the env. variables
```
export USE_MPI=y  
export NWCHEM_TARGET=MACX64  
export NWCHEM_TOP=/Users/johndoe/nwchem  
export USE_INTERNALBLAS=y
```
  - **Important**: set the following env. variable (GA will not compile
    otherwise)
```
export CFLAGS_FORGA "-DMPICH_NO_ATTR_TYPE_TAGS"
```
  - Go to your source directory, configure, and compile
```
 cd /Users/johndoe/nwchem/src  
 make nwchem_config`  
 make
```
**WARNING:** Please do not use the Mac OS X default BLAS and LAPACK
libraries available (or brew's veclibfort), since they are causing
NWChem to produce erroneous results

#### Method \#3: using Intel compilers and MKL

The Intel compilers and MKL work just fine on Mac with the following
options:

```
NWCHEM_TARGET=MACX64
CC=icc
FC=ifort
BLASOPT="-mkl -openmp"
USE_OPENMP=T
```

MPICH and ARMCI-MPI work reliably on Mac. See [Choosing the ARMCI
Library](ARMCI) for details on ARMCI-MPI

## How-to: Cray platforms

Common environmental variables for building and running on the Cray XT, XE, XC and XK:
```
  % export NWCHEM_TOP=<your path>/nwchem  
  % export NWCHEM_TARGET=LINUX64  
  % export NWCHEM_MODULES=all  
  % export USE_MPI=y
  % export USE_MPIF=y 
  % export USE_MPIF4=y 
  % export USE_SCALAPACK=y 
  % export USE_64TO32=y  
  % export LIBMPI=" "
```
  - **Compiling the code on Cray once all variables (described below)
    are set**
```
  % cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src
  % make nwchem_config
  % make 64_to_32
  % make FC=ftn >& make.log
```
The step `make 64_to_32` is required only if either SCALAPACK\_SIZE or
BLAS\_SIZE are set equal to 4.

## How-to: Intel Xeon Phi

This section describes both the newer KNL and older KNC hardware, in
reverse chronological order.

  - **Compiling NWChem on self-hosted Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing
    processors**

NWChem 6.6 (and later versions) support OpenMP threading, which is
essential to obtaining good performance with NWChem on Intel Xeon Phi
many-core processors.  
As of November 2016, the development version of NWChem contains
threading support in the TCE coupled-cluster codes (primarily
non-iterative triples in e.g. CCSD(T)), semi-direct CCSD(T), and
plane-wave DFT (i.e. NWPW).

Required for compilation: Intel compilers, version 16+ (17+ is strongly
recommended).

Environmental variables required for compilation:
```
% export USE_KNL=1 
% export USE_OPENMP=1  
% export USE_F90_ALLOCATABLE=T  
% export USE_FASTMEM=T
```
The latter two options are required to allocate temporaries in MCDRAM
when running in flat mode. Please do not use cache mode for NWChem
CCSD(T) codes. Note that using Fortran heap allocations means the memory
statistics generated by MA are no longer accurate, but we doubt that
anyone has been relying on these anyways.


`USE_FASTMEM` requires the _memkind_ library to be installed.
An open source version of the memkind library can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/memkind/memkind)

Side note: With the exception of `USE_FASTMEM`, all of the options in
the KNL section apply to Intel Xeon processors as well. OpenMP is
certainly useful on multicore processors as a way to reduce the
communication overhead and memory footprint of NWChem.

When using MKL and Intel 16+, please use the following
settings
```
% export BLASOPT  ="-mkl -qopenmp" 
% export SCALAPACK="-mkl -qopenmp -lmkl_scalapack_ilp64 -lmkl_blacs_intelmpi_ilp64"
```
The command require for compilation is
```
$ make FC=ifort CC=icc
```
Environmental variables recommended at runtime (assuming Intel OpenMP
and MPI):
```
% export I_MPI_PIN=1  
% export I_MPI_DEBUG=4  
% export KMP_BLOCKTIME=1 
% export KMP_AFFINITY=scatter,verbose
```
Once you are comfortable with the affinity settings, you can use these
instead:
```
% export I_MPI_PIN=1
% export KMP_BLOCKTIME=1  
% export KMP_AFFINITY=scatter
```
Please consult the Intel or similar documentation regarding MPI+OpenMP
affinity on your system. This is a complicated issue that depends on the
software you use; it is impossible to document all the different
combinations of MPI and OpenMP implementations that may be used with
NWChem.

If you encounter segfaults not related to ARMCI, you may need to set the
following or recompile with `-heap-arrays`. Please create thread in the
Forum if you observe this.
```
% ulimit -s unlimited  
% export OMP_STACKSIZE=32M
```
  - **Compiling NWChem on hosts equipped with Intel Xeon Phi Knights
    Corner coprocessors**

NWChem 6.5 (and later versions) offers the possibility of using Intel
Xeon Phi hardware to perform the most computationally intensive part of
the CCSD(T) calculations (non-iterative triples corrections).

Required for compilation: Intel Composer XE version 14.0.3 (or later
versions)

Environmental variables required for compilation:
```
% export USE_OPENMP=1 
% export USE_OFFLOAD=1
```
When using MKL and Intel Composer XE version 14 (or later versions),
please use the following
settings
```
% export BLASOPT  ="-mkl -openmp   -lpthread -lm"  
% export SCALAPACK="-mkl -openmp -lmkl_scalapack_ilp64 -lmkl_blacs_intelmpi_ilp64 -lpthread -lm"
```
The command require for compilation is
```
$ make FC=ifort 
```
  - **Examples of recommended configurations**

From our experience using the CCSD(T) TCE module, we have determined
that the optimal configuration is to use a single Global Arrays ranks
for offloading work to each Xeon Phi card.

On the EMSL cascade system, each node is equipped with two coprocessors,
and NWChem can allocate one GA ranks per coprocessor. In the job
scripts, we recommend spawning just 6 GA ranks for each node, instead of
16 (number that would match the number of physical cores). Therefore, 2
out 6 GA ranks assigned to a particular compute node will offload to the
coprocessors, while the remaining 6 cores while be used for traditional
CPU processing duties. Since during offload the host core is idle, we
can double the number of OpenMP threads for the host
(`OMP_NUM_THREADS=4`) in order to fill the idle core with work from
another GA rank (4 process with 4 threads each will total 16 threads on
each node).

NWChem itself automatically detects the available coprocessors in the
system and properly partitions them for optimal use, therefore no action
is required other than specifying the number of processes on each node
(using the appropriate mpirun/mpiexec options) and setting the value of
`OMP_NUM_THREADS` as in the example above.

Environmental variables useful at run-time:

OMP\_NUM\_THREADS is needed for the thread-level parallelization on the
Xeon CPU hosts

```
% export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
```

MIC\_USE\_2MB\_BUFFER greatly improve communication between host and
Xeon Phi card

```
% export MIC_USE_2MB_BUFFER=16K
```

**Very important**: when running on
clusters equipped with Xeon Phi and Infiniband network hardware
(requiring `ARMCI_NETWORK=OPENIB`), the following env. variable is
required, even in the case when the Xeon Phi hardware is not
utilized.

```
% export ARMCI_OPENIB_DEVICE=mlx4_0
```

## How-to: IBM platforms

## How-to: Commodity clusters with Infiniband

Common environmental variables for building and running on most
Infiniband clusters are:
```
  export NWCHEM_TOP=<your path>/nwchem  
  export NWCHEM_TARGET=LINUX64 
  export NWCHEM_MODULES="all"  
  export USE_MPI=y

```
  - On Infiniband clusters with the OpenIB software stack, the following
    environment variables should be defined
```
  export ARMCI_NETWORK=OPENIB 
  export IB_INCLUDE=<Location of Infiniband libraries>/include  
```
  - Compiling the code on an Infiniband cluster once all variables are
    set
```

## How-to: Windows Platforms
### MingW
The current recommended approach for building a NWChem binary for a
Windows platform is to build with the
[MinGW/Mingw32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/) environment. MinGW can be
installed using a semi-automatic tool mingw-get-setup.exe
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/). A basic MinGW
installation is required (Basic Setup), plus pthreads-32,
mingw32-gcc-fortran-dev of "All Packages" and the MSYS software.  
More detailed MinGW/MSYS installation tips can be found in the following
forum discussions

|                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <https://nwchemgit.github.io/Special_AWCforum/sp/id5124.html> |
| <https://nwchemgit.github.io/Special_AWCforum/sp/id6628.html> |

Another essential prerequisite step is to install Mpich, which can be
found at the following
URL

<http://www.mpich.org/static/tarballs/1.4.1p1/mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-ia32.msi>

Once Mpich is installed, you should copy the installation files to a
different location to avoid the failure of the tools compilation. You
can use the following command
```
% cp -rp /c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/MPICH2/ ~/
```
You might want to install Python, too, by using the following
installation file

<https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.8/python-2.7.8.msi>

Next, you need to set the env.
```
% export NWCHEM_TOP=~/nwchem-6.8  
% export NWCHEM_TARGET=LINUX
% export USE_MPI=y  
% export MPI_LOC=~/MPICH2  
% export MPI_INCLUDE=$MPI_LOC/include  
% export MPI_LIB=$MPI_LOC/lib  
% export LIBMPI="-lfmpich2g -lmpi"  
% export PYTHONVERSION=27  
% export DEPEND_CC=gcc
% export USE_INTERNALBLAS=y
% export NWCHEM_MODULES=all
```
Then, you can start the compilation by typing
```
% cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src  
% make nwchem_config  
% make FC=gfortran DEPEND_CC=gcc
```
#### MSYS2

https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/MSYS2-installation
```
pacman -Syuu
pacman -S mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-gcc-fortran
pacman -S mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-python3
pacman -S msys/make
```

### WSL on Windows 10
A good alternative only on Windows 10 is **Windows Subsystem for Linux** (WSL).
This option gives the best performance on Windows when [WLS 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) is used.
**WSL** allows you to obtain a functional command line Linux 64-bit NWChem environment, either by compiling the NWChem code from scratch or by using the Ubuntu precompiled NWChem package. Here is a link to the install guide

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

Once Ubuntu is installed, the quickest method to install NWChem is by fetching the Ubuntu NWChem package by typing
```
sudo apt install nwchem
``` 

## General site installation

The build procedures outlined above will allow use of NWChem within the
NWChem directory structure. The code will look for the basis set library
file in a default place within that directory structure. To install the
code in a general, public place (e.g., /usr/local/NWChem) the following
procedure can be applied:

  - Determine the local storage path for the install files. (e.g.,
    /usr/local/NWChem).
  - Make directories

```
mkdir /usr/local/NWChem
mkdir /usr/local/NWChem/bin
mkdir /usr/local/NWChem/data
```

  - Copy binary

```
cp $NWCHEM_TOP/bin/${NWCHEM_TARGET}/nwchem /usr/local/NWChem/bin
cd /usr/local/NWChem/bin
chmod 755 nwchem
```

  - Set links to data files (basis sets, force fields, etc.)

```
cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src/basis
cp -r libraries /usr/local/NWChem/data
cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src/
cp -r data /usr/local/NWChem
cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src/nwpw
cp -r libraryps /usr/local/NWChem/data
```

  - Each user will need a .nwchemrc file to point to these default data
    files. A global one could be put in /usr/local/NWChem/data and a
    symbolic link made in each users `$HOME` directory is probably the
    best plan for new installations. Users would have to issue the following
    command prior to using NWChem:
```
ln -s /usr/local/NWChem/data/default.nwchemrc $HOME/.nwchemrc
```

Contents of the `default.nwchemrc` file based on the above information
should be:

```
nwchem_basis_library /usr/local/NWChem/data/libraries/
nwchem_nwpw_library /usr/local/NWChem/data/libraryps/
ffield amber
amber_1 /usr/local/NWChem/data/amber_s/
amber_2 /usr/local/NWChem/data/amber_q/
amber_3 /usr/local/NWChem/data/amber_x/
amber_4 /usr/local/NWChem/data/amber_u/
spce    /usr/local/NWChem/data/solvents/spce.rst
charmm_s /usr/local/NWChem/data/charmm_s/
charmm_x /usr/local/NWChem/data/charmm_x/
```

Of course users can copy this file instead of making the symbolic link
described above and change these defaults at their discretion.

It is can also be useful to use the `NWCHEM_BASIS_LIBRARY` environment
variable when testing a new installation when an old one exists. This
will allow you to overwrite the value of `nwchem_basis_library` in your
`.nwchemrc` file and point to the new basis library. For example:

```
% export NWCHEM_BASIS_LIBRARY="$NWCHEM/data-5.0/libraries/"
```

Do not forget the trailing "/".
